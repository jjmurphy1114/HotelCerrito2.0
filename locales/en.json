I am Amalio Enciso, Director of the School. It is a pleasure to welcome you to “Our House”! I invite you to look at the map where you can see the school campus and production areas. Right now, you are located at the red circle.\n\nThe School was founded in 1960 by the order of German Franciscan Brothers. Twenty years later, the Franciscan Brothers donated the school to the Christian Brothers of La Salle, whose mission is to educate.\n\nIn 2002, due to the financial crisis of 2000, the De La Salle Brothers offered the school to Fundación Paraguaya as a donation, with the agreement to continue with the curriculum of vocational technique in agriculture, but to add financial and entrepreneurial education.\n\nThe Paraguayan Foundation developed an Educational-Productive Business Plan with the three objectives of:\n\n• Employability for all graduates \n\n• A curriculum focused on the market \n\n• A one hundred percent self-sufficient institution, without state resources\n\nThe School achieved financial self-sufficiency in 2007, covering 100% of the operating budget and 40 salaries without receiving contributions from the government, and remains self-sufficient today. In this way, the Cerrito Agricultural School has served as inspiration for many schools around the world seeking to achieve their self-sufficiency.",

        "text1": "There is a family of black-and-gold howler monkeys, also known as Alouatta caraya, that reside on the Cerrito School and Hotel campus. All monkeys of this species are born with gold fur. The females remain gold while the males turn black as they mature.\n\nHowler monkeys are calm animals and do not engage in direct contact with humans unless threatened. They are most active during sunrise and sunset and usually seen in the trees. They use their prehensile tails to hang on branches and sleep at night on high and safe branches.\n\nThey are known as howler monkeys because of the howling-like sounds they make to defend their territory, communicate with other groups, and coordinate their movements within the group. It is common for them to howl at dawn and dusk as a way to establish their territorial boundaries.\n\nHowler monkeys commonly eat leaves, however they also eat flowers, tender shoots, and fruits such as mangos. When in season, the local family of howler monkeys at Cerrito enjoy climbing the mango trees on campus and eating the fruit. They serve an important ecological role in seed dispersion as they commonly throw seeds on the ground after finishing their fruits.",
        "text2": "Since howler monkeys are most active at dawn and dusk, we recommend walking through campus during those times for the best chance of seeing the monkeys. As you walk, look for movement in the tree tops and listen for their howling (see the audio player below for an audio sample).\n\nTo avoid interfering with their natural activities and reduce the risk of disease transmission, observation of the monkeys should be passive, silent, in small groups, and at a minimum distance of 10 meters.\n\nWhile the howler monkeys can be seen throughout campus, they can often be found in the following places:\n\n- The bamboo grove by the animal production center\n\n- The trees by both sets of cabins\n\n- The trees between the bakery, hotel, and Jazmín cabin"
