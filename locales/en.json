        "text1": "There is a family of black-and-gold howler monkeys, also known as Alouatta caraya, that reside on the Cerrito School and Hotel campus. All monkeys of this species are born with gold fur. The females remain gold while the males turn black as they mature.\n\nHowler monkeys are calm animals and do not engage in direct contact with humans unless threatened. They are most active during sunrise and sunset and usually seen in the trees. They use their prehensile tails to hang on branches and sleep at night on high and safe branches.\n\nThey are known as howler monkeys because of the howling-like sounds they make to defend their territory, communicate with other groups, and coordinate their movements within the group. It is common for them to howl at dawn and dusk as a way to establish their territorial boundaries.\n\nHowler monkeys commonly eat leaves, however they also eat flowers, tender shoots, and fruits such as mangos. When in season, the local family of howler monkeys at Cerrito enjoy climbing the mango trees on campus and eating the fruit. They serve an important ecological role in seed dispersion as they commonly throw seeds on the ground after finishing their fruits.",
        "text2": "Since howler monkeys are most active at dawn and dusk, we recommend walking through campus during those times for the best chance of seeing the monkeys. As you walk, look for movement in the tree tops and listen for their howling (see the audio player below for an audio sample).\n\nTo avoid interfering with their natural activities and reduce the risk of disease transmission, observation of the monkeys should be passive, silent, in small groups, and at a minimum distance of 10 meters.\n\nWhile the howler monkeys can be seen throughout campus, they can often be found in the following places:\n\n- The bamboo grove by the animal production center\n\n- The trees by both sets of cabins\n\n- The trees between the bakery, hotel, and Jazmín cabin"
